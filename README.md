# Splunk Add-on for Puppet Enterprise

The Splunk Add-on for Puppet Enterprise collects machine data from using the PuppetDB API.

## Requirements to run this add-on

- Splunk Enterprise 7.0+
- Puppet Enterprise 2018.1.1+
- Splunk App for Puppet Enterprise (Obtain from [Github](https://github.com/puppetlabs/SplunkAppforPuppetEnterprise/)) â€” _This component visualises data from Puppet Enterprise collected and stored in Splunk by this add-on._

## Installation Steps

1. First generate an authentication token for Puppet Enterprise. Make sure to specify a suffeciently long lifetime for the token. We recommend at least 12 months. Detailed instructions are available from the [Puppet Enterprise documentation](https://puppet.com/docs/pe/latest/rbac_token_auth_intro.html#generate-a-token-using-the-api-endpoint).

    Sample command:

    ```shell
    curl -k -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -d '{"login": "", "password": "","lifetime": "9y" }' https://$:4433/rbac-api/v1/auth/token
    ```

    You'll get back something that looks like `eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9`. Keep this handy for the next step.

1. Navigate to the Add-on within the Splunk console.
1. Select the "Create New Input" on the "Data inputs" view. Follow the instructions in the forms to connect the add-on to your Puppet Enterprise installation. It asks for things like server name, authentication token, and so on.
1. Install the companion [app](https://github.com/puppetlabs/SplunkAppforPuppetEnterprise/) into Splunk to visualize data ingested from Puppet Enterprise.
